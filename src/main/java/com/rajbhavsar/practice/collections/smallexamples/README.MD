    1) Choose three of the collections you have learned (concrete classes) 
    and think of a scenario in which it would be most appropriate to use that collection over the others. 
    You will be presenting the scenario to the class and letting them guess what collection you are talking about.
    (1st is In general question No solution is there in this code.)
    2) Write a method that reads in a series of first names and eliminates duplicates 
    by storing them in a Set. It should return the Set.
    3) Use a HashMap to create a reusable class for choosing 
    one of the 13 predefined colors in class Color. 
    The names of the colors should be used as keys, and the predefined Color  objects should be 
    used as values. It should return the HashMap .
    4) Write a method to count the number of occurrences of each letter in a string. 
    For example, the string "HELLO THERE" contains two Hs, three Es, two Ls, one O, one T and one R. 
    It should return an object that contains the results – what kind of class is best suited for this?
    5) Write a method that returns the number of duplicate words in a sentence. 
    Treat uppercase and lowercase letters the same. Ignore punctuation.
    6) Write a method that takes in a LinkedList and returns a 
    LinkedList object containing a copy of the first list, but in reverse order.
    7) Write a method that uses a String method split 
    to tokenize a line of text input by the user and places each token in a TreeSet. 
    It should return the TreeSet. 
    Note: Printing the TreeSet should output the elements ascending sorted order.
    8) Create a method that takes in a variable argument of type double and 
    returns a PriorityQueue that orders the doubles in descending order 
    (i.e., 14.8 should be the highest-priority element rather than 2.2)
